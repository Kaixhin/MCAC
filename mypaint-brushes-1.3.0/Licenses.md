## Licenses and Copyrights

MyPaint brushes's copyrights and applicable licenses are enumerated
in machine-readable form
in the file named [Licenses.dep5][DEP5LIC].
This file is also fairly human-readable plain text;
it's formatted in Debian's DEP5 format
for machine readable `copyright` files.
The DEP5 file is to be considered
the master document for copyright and licensing information.
A brief, non-legalistic summary of MyPaint's licensing follows:

* MyPaint is licensed under the terms of the GNU Public License,
  version 2.0 or later. See the file [COPYING][GPL2] in this folder.
  Unless otherwise stated, this license applies to all files.
* Many artist resource files and brushes
  are released into the public domain.
* Other, compatible licenses apply.

See [Licenses.dep5][DEP5LIC] for details and full texts of all licenses.

Our current [Licensing Policy][LICPOL] can be found in the MyPaint wiki.
